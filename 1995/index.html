<p>The Bad Subjects Production Team, authors of the Manifesto for Bad
Subjects in Cyberspace, are primariy concerned with communal production
and relations in cyberspace. Reminding the reader that cyberspace is
malleable and unpredictable, the Bad Subjects Production Team desire to
create a digital space that opposes both liberal communal institutions
and the exploitative forces of capital.</p>

<p>While communities in cyberspace might have radical potential, it is
important to keep in mind that such potential is not inherent to the
medium itself. Cyberspace is not itself a community; many types of
communities exist on computer networks, most of which are nothing more
than an extension of the kinds of routine interactions we expect to
encounter in capitalism.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In September of 1993, the Bad Subjects Collective published 'A
Manifesto for Bad Subjects,' in which we offered a critique of existing
leftist politics. We argued that the Left today is characterized by
cynicism, an investment in multiculturalism which emphasizes separatism,
and a desire to compensate for its ineffectiveness by celebrating
victimization and marginalization. At that time, Bad Subjects was just
beginning to establish a presence on the Internet by organizing an
e-mail list and setting up a gopher site where an electronic version of
our publication is available. Through these avenues, our manifesto
reached an audience larger than we had ever imagined possible. We
received responses from as far away as Russia and New Zealand; the
manifesto was even taught in classes across the United States. It has
now become clear that Bad Subjects identity and popularity are largely a
result of our on-line presence. While hard copies of the publication
continue to be circulated, the vast majority of our readers come to us
through the Internet.</p>
<p>In the manifesto, we recommended that leftist politics be more relevant
to our everyday lives; in this way, we hoped to suggest a new
relationship between personal and political commitments. Because our
everyday life as bad subjects takes place largely on the Net, we want to
offer an example of how to put this recommendation into practice.
Whereas the Internet was once just a way for us to disseminate our
articles, it has now become an important social context for the exchange
and development of what on-line users have dubbed badsubjectian ideas.
In short, cyberspace has become both an organizing tool and meeting
place for bad subjects. It has also come to resemble --- in some ways
--- the kind of Utopian community we imagined in our original manifesto.
What follows represents our collective effort to explore the radical
potential of cyberspace, while acknowledging its limitations.</p>
<h3 id="cyberspace-and-global-capital">Cyberspace and Global Capital</h3>
<p>Cyberspace is the technological fetish of the moment, just as the
telephone, automobile, radio, and television once were. In this sense,
cyberspace can be said to represent the next logical step in the
expansion of the mass media. Throughout the 20th Century, leftists from
the Frankfurt School to contemporary critics such as Douglas Kellner and
Todd Gitlin have been debating whether the mass media are a progressive
or reactionary force. There has always been a danger that the mass media
will only function as propaganda for the ruling classes. But at the same
time, independent uses of mass media by radical groups have been cited
as examples of the subversive potential of cheap technologies which can
help organize and inform the masses.</p>
<p>Popular histories of the Internet generally underscore its chaotic and
seemingly unreal structure. An Esquire magazine guide to getting on-line
(December, 1994) by Phil Patton is typical, describing a dizzying
landscape...whose ruling philosophy is complexity theory --- the happy
belief that this chaos will all sort itself out somehow, someday, and
meanwhile, hey, go with the flow. ARPANET, the seed from which the
Internet grew, was one of the US Department of Defenses innumerable
Cold-War projects. Pattons history of the Internet parallels that of
most other popular accounts in noting that its military origins did not
prevent it from being appropriated by civilians. As the net became a
means of communication, Patton writes, on its margins, just as beside
the railroad or blacktop, a new culture began to sprout. Despite its
historical connection to American nationalist politics, the Internet is
perceived to be a place where anarchy reigns: state-planning created the
Internet, but has now lost control over it.</p>
<p>Discussions of the Internets radical potential have tended to focus on
this anarchic quality. Commentators have celebrated the ways in which
the Internet has frustrated attempts by centralized powers to steer its
development in a particular direction. Understandably, leftists wary of
state power have agreed with them. But celebrating the chaos of the
Internet comes dangerously close to celebrating the so-called free
market of capitalism. The free market is supposed to be a space of
productive chaos inimical to regulation. Ideally it functions all by
itself without any political or economic steering. The free market
promotes individualism; indeed, it is thought to function best when it
encompasses a great diversity of tastes and needs. Moreover, the free
market is a fiction which disguises the web of unequal social
relationships constituting it.</p>
<p>Substituting the word cyberspace for free market in these descriptions
allows us to see that what we value about cyberspace resembles what the
Left has criticized about capitalism. Like global capitalism, computer
networks bring people together in alienation rather than solidarity.
People who interact on-line are generally not privy to the way those
networks are produced by actual people existing within a concrete
economic order. Cyberspace is a commodity in the process of being
produced by programmers, paid system operators, and a range of
volunteers who parcel out memory to users, generate more complicated
interactive data spaces, and maintain order on newsgroups, mailing
lists, and FTP sites. The Net is not antithetical to the free market, to
consumerism, or to alienated labor. After all, science fiction author
William Gibson invented the term cyberspace to describe virtual reality
in a future dominated by multinational corporations and wealthy elites
who prey on a vast, international underclass.</p>
<p>While communities in cyberspace might have radical potential, it is
important to keep in mind that such potential is not inherent to the
medium itself. Cyberspace is not itself a community; many types of
communities exist on computer networks, most of which are nothing more
than an extension of the kinds of routine interactions we expect to
encounter in capitalism. On Usenet and the World Wide Web, for example,
we encounter thinner and thinner boundaries between personal expression,
politics, and advertising. There are newsgroups devoted simply to job
listings. On World Wide Web, you might click on a word in the middle of
an article about progressive politics in Slovenia and find yourself
linked to an infoblurb promoting tourism in Eastern Europe. On-line
galleries exist in a number of locations for the purposes of selling
art, music, or text. Thus, the Internet reflects the economic and social
conditions that underpin it.</p>
<p>In our excitement over the Internets potential, we must be wary of
buying into the ideology of the free market it mirrors. If we value the
Internet because it is chaotic, decentered, and promotes individuality
for its own sake, then it is only a matter of time before we start to
value the free market for the same reasons.</p>
<h3 id="democracy-is-not-utopia">Democracy Is Not Utopia</h3>
<p>Promises of a good society offered by cybernetic communication are
familiar to us by now. They come out of what we might call the
democratic Utopianism espoused by everyone from techno-anarchists like
the staff of Mondo 2000 to self-styled conservative futurist Newt
Gingrich. Like the fiction of a free market, on-line democratic
Utopianism is heavily informed by a belief that unhindered personal
expression is the measure of our social freedom.</p>
<p>In on-line democratic Utopianism, cyberspace community ends up emulating
political communities in physical reality. Hence, the drawbacks of
actually existing democracy as we know it in the United States are
prevalent in computer networks: the middle- and upper-classes constitute
the largest and most vocal group, promoting their own interests without
having to pay attention to the needs and desires of the underclasses and
disenfranchised groups. Much has been made, for example, of the way
politicians, local governments, and special interest groups can have
town hall meetings in virtual reality and hear from the people. But on
the Net, after all, one pays for the privilege of participating in any
town hall meeting. Moreover, cyberspace runs the risk of becoming
individualist to the point of parody, where personal expression is
overvalued so much that it is impossible to assert anything unless it
begins with the cyberslang disclaimer IMO .in my opinion..</p>
<p>An overemphasis on the personal has led to many of the problems leftists
face today when they try to organize themselves as a mass community once
more. Personal or identity politics have led to distrust of all groups
which attempt to take a strong, unified stance which might appeal to
mainstream society. Multiculturalism has helped Americans to modify
their interpersonal relations --- making it rude and often illegal to be
racist or sexist --- but it has also undermined our ability to view the
political as political. Lacking a clear vision of politics which go
beyond the personal, the Left shies away from any program or set of
goals which assert that large numbers of people can change society for
the better. Whose society are you talking about? the multiculturalist
might ask. Hearing that this society is one we all share, the
multiculturalist disgustedly replies, No such society exists, and if it
did, it would be oppressive. Certainly this is the case if all politics
are merely personal, since no two people can share the same life. But
politics go beyond individual experience.</p>
<p>To bring about a more just society, the left must commit to a politics
which validate personal identity while at the same time transcending it.
For this reason, the potential for political community in cyberspace
seems particularly salient. On a computer network, identity as we know
it in our daily lives is altered. Because we cannot instantly see each
other as races, genders, ages, etc., in a computer environment, peoples
impulse to judge one another as such is hindered. We could never argue
that these judgments do not occur, and certainly many people on-line
make sure to identify themselves somewhere on the multiculturalist
spectrum. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to assert that radical
communities on-line would not fall out along the same lines as they
might in physical reality.</p>
<p>Computer networks are, as many commentators have noted, global, or, at
the very least, international. Indeed, since going on-line, the Bad
Subjects mailing list and readers have been made up of people from
around the world. A radical community in cyberspace would, therefore, be
constituted by a population united by their desire to affect more than
simply their cultural group or national region. Insofar as people can
choose how, or if, to represent their (multicultural) identities
on-line, cyberspace may provide the ultimate forum for performative
identities. That is, a woman on-line might perform the identity of a
man, and vice versa. In some ways, we might be tempted to celebrate
this, arguing that such a performance undermines the allegedly fixed
nature of race, gender, ethnicity, etc.. Such on-line performances take
us, perhaps, a small step beyond multiculturalism as we now know it.</p>
<p>What remains fixed, however, are the sites from which on-line access is
made available. E-mail address suffixes such as org .organization.,
gov .government. and edu .education. locate the user within a system
of commercial, state, and educational networks. Outside the United
States, users are also identified by a country code in their suffix.
Although anonymous servers exist which can erase users addresses, these
are not entirely foolproof, and their use is limited. This suggests that
while multicultural identities can be temporarily transcended (or
reinscribed) in cyberspace, work --- or class --- identities cannot.
Cyberspace identities may suggest a post-multicultural and post-national
world, but they do not entirely escape their social context.</p>
<h3 id="the-use-of-liberal-safe-spaces">The Use of Liberal 'Safe Spaces'</h3>
<p>Built into the structure of any radical politics is an injunction to
form communities. We know for certain that social change is dependent
upon teamwork --- and the kind of teams we form as radicals can,
ideally, become the blueprints for what a better society might look
like. Unfortunately, leftist and other radical communities are notorious
for their instability and hypocrisy. In the late 60s, the New Left and
civil rights movements spawned the womens movement precisely because, to
women and their allies, sexist behavior in these movements seemed so
clearly in conflict with their stated goals of equality and social
justice. Subsequently, the womens movement and other civil rights groups
of the 70s, 80s, and 90s have asserted that the personal is political in
order to encourage continuity between political convictions and everyday
actions.</p>
<p>The limitations of a multiculturalist position are, in part, the impetus
behind our ongoing commitment to Bad Subjects. The project of Bad
Subjects has always been to provide a forum for the discussion of
leftist politics and, out of that, to build a political community and
promote social change. While the hard-copy publication offers a place
for people to articulate a substantial and coherent position on an
aspect of contemporary culture, the on-line mailing list is a space
where people can discuss, more informally, 'political education for
everyday life.' On the list, people debate the possible ways in which
the Left might be more effective at both understanding and transforming
contemporary society. It resembles, therefore, a kind of 'safe space'
or 'support group' that allows for the free exchange of ideas and
positions. While only a few list members may participate at any given
time, the messages are 'bounced' to the 200 or so people who currently
subscribe to the list. Even when people do not agree with each other,
one result is the on-going production of a 'badsubjectian' position on
whatever happens to be the topic at hand. The mailing list, therefore,
collectively articulates a position (albeit sometimes a provisional one)
on a topic. By participating, list members are acting in ways that
suggest the kind of political community the Bad Subjects collective has
always tried to work towards.</p>
<p>This kind of free exchange can have its limitations, however. As with
any 'safe space' there is a need to be aware of the extent to which
containing political discussions within places like the mailing list can
give us a false sense of our power to transform society. One problem is
that the free exchange of ideas can quickly turn into a debate where
every position is considered equally valid. While most people on the
list are already committed to leftist politics, discussions occasionally
become mired in the kind of individualism mentioned earlier, precluding
the possibility of criticism or the articulation of a more coherent,
and, ultimately, useful position. While a degree of 'liberal
pluralism' --- where everyone's opinion is equally valued and
respected --- is necessary, and the safe space of the list allows for,
and, indeed, promotes, such a dynamic, there is a time where a stand
needs to be taken in order for any substantial change to be possible.</p>
<p>While discussions on the Bad Subjects mailing list may suggest a kind of
collective politics, there is need to distinguish between the feeling of
political community that a list can generate, and the ability to make
productive use of that community to enact material changes in the world.
As with any support group, there is, moreover, a need to leave the group
behind and use the techniques and knowledge gained from the list in our
lives outside of cyberspace. Indeed, there are many social and political
changes that the list makes possible. The exchange of ideas can, and
often does, promote a shift in consciousness that contains within itself
real material effects. Many people on the list are students, professors,
or writers, who use ideas and resources from the list, for example, to
change the ways in which they teach and learn in their respective
professions.</p>
<p>We need to create a balance between the liberal pluralism found in
places like the mailing list and the kind of radical politics that can
effectively transform society. There is nothing inherently radical,
after all, about either multiculturalism or liberal pluralism. Indeed,
both frequently reinforce --- by creating 'alternative' or 'niche'
markets --- the structures of capitalism that we aim to dismantle. While
it is, of course, important to be conscious of many social and political
perspectives, we must also self-consciously maintain a position that
opposes, rather than validates, the structures and ideology of
capitalism.</p>
<p>The kinds of interactive discussions taking place on the mailing list
break down the boundary between producers and consumers of ideas and
actions. Our desire is not to merely reach a mass audience whom we can
educate, in other words, but to encourage people to act in the world to
effect real social change. We work to make possible a world in which
on-line members are not merely passive recipients of 'badsubjectian'
ideas, but active agents helping us to articulate such a position and
enact it in the world at large. Self-consciousness about the political
potential of cyberspace is, thus, not an end in itself. We must leave
the Net behind and use it only as an impetus for social change in the
'real' material world.</p>
<h3 id="a-radical-program-for-cyberspace">A Radical Program for Cyberspace</h3>
<p>Cyberspace community is just another form of community, with all its
potential pitfalls and triumphs. The form that a community takes is
ultimately not the point --- but what you do with that community is. And
this is why we believe that on-line and real life communities are not in
opposition to one another, or in a hierarchical relationship. These
communities exist in relation to each other, and are in the process of
making each other quite different as a result of their relationship.
Real communities may have invented cybercommunities, but at this point
there are real communities and relationships which have been forged in
cyberspace. Hence, cyberspace and real society are in a dialectical
relationship --- they mutually create and influence each other.</p>
<p>The materialist dialectic of Marxist tradition is often interpreted to
mean a set of relationships in which materiality is the most important
factor. This, as many theorists have pointed out, depends on how you
define materiality. As much as cyberspace would seem to be the realm of
ideas, hence non-material, one needs to remember that there is a
materiality to cyberspace. If there were no such materiality, we could
not assert that some people have access to it while others do not. Nor
could we compare the structure of cyberspace to the structure of
capitalism, which is a notoriously materialistic system. Like all raw
materials, cyberspace is unequally distributed throughout the world.
Hence cyberspace has materiality and an ideology --- there are actual
ports, machines, and RAM; and there are beliefs we have about it and
ways we behave in it. Cybercommunity, like real life community, is a
combination of raw materials and human conviviality.</p>
<p>It is therefore reasonable to assume that radical politics in cyberspace
do have a relationship to practices in non-virtual reality. A radical
political program in cyberspace would recommend actions intended to
equalize access to its raw materials and information. It would promote
localized and global participation in the maintenance of cyberspace
society, or its structure and laws. Finally, it would open up avenues by
which anti-capitalist thought might be disseminated and national
boundaries eroded. All these actions would have as their intended goal
the construction of a future, Utopian society in which human identities
are global and people are united by a commitment to justice, shared
labor, socialized property, and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.</p>
<p>For the present, cyberspace is in its infancy. In critical discussions,
often we speak of potential ways cyberspace might develop as a
technology and as a social force. To theorize cyberspace is also to
imaginatively project ourselves as a society into the future. Cyberspace
is more than just a system of computers; it is also a network of human
relationships in the process of emerging. What is Utopian about
cyberspace at this point in history is that its structure is obviously
not entirely fixed. Perhaps, in deciding how we wish to organize the
future of cyberspace, we can teach ourselves that, indeed, the future of
human society is not fixed either. We can always choose to be different,
and more importantly, we can always choose to be better. Like cyberspace
itself, this manifesto is an invitation to remember that, as individuals
and as a society, this choice is always ours.</p>
