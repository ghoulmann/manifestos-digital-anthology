<h2 id="hackers-myth">Hacker's Myth</h2>
<p>This is a statement on the fate of the modern underground. There will be
none of the nostalgia, melodrama, black hat rhetoric or white hat
over-analysis that normally accompanies such writing.</p>
<p>Since the early sixties there has been just one continuous hacking
scene. From phreaking to hacking, people came and went, explosions of
activity, various geographical shifts of influence. But although the
scene seemed to constantly redefine itself in the ebb and flow of
technology, it always had a direct lineage to the past, with similar
traditions, culture and spirit.</p>
<p>In the past few years this connection has been completely severed.</p>
<p>And so there's very little point in writing about what the underground
used to be; leave that to the historians. Very little point writing
about what should be done to make everything good again; leave that to
the dreamers and idealists. Instead I'm going to lay down some cold
hard facts about the way things are now, and more importantly, how they
came to be this way.</p>
<p>This is the story of how the underground died.</p>
<h2 id="the-security-industry">The Security Industry</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Then in the U.S. music scene there was big changes made Due to
circumstances beyond our control... such as payola The rock n roll
scene died after two years of solid rock - The Animals, circa 1964</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is little doubt that the explosion of the security industry has
directly coincided with the decline of the hacking scene. The hackers of
the eighties and nineties became the security professionals of the new
millennium, and the community suffered for it.</p>
<p>The fact is that hackers, mostly on an individual basis, decided to use
their passion as a source of income. Whether this is good, bad, or just
pragmatic is completely irrelevant. Nearly all the hackers that could
get jobs did. For the individuals that decision has been made (for
better or worse), and in general there's nothing that will change this.</p>
<p>This was a hacker exodus. What really mattered was not the loss of any
individuals, but the cumulative effect this had on the underground. The
more hackers that left the underground for a corporate life, the fewer
that came in. And those who stayed became entrenched, increasingly
disconnected.</p>
<p>Collaboration in this new age of career hackers has all but ceased to
exist. Individuals are now obsessed with credit. For their career, for
their standing in the community, it must be absolutely clear who this
research, this vulnerability, or even this opinion belongs to.</p>
<p>There is no trust in this corporate community; an underground issue
greatly amplified by corporate motivations. A single person can go
months or even years without telling anyone exactly what he is working
on, and whats more, will be genuinely worried about someone
"publishing" their results before him. There is no respect for the
information he holds, no belief that information should be free, no
belief that research should be open. All that matters is credit; all
that matters is fame and money, their career.</p>
<p>This is purely the fault of the security industry, who has exploited and
cultivated this culture, designed it for their needs. The truly sad
thing is that the corporate security world hasn't realized that they
are sitting on a gold mine, and as a result the mine is likely to
collapse; and likely to take their industry down with it.</p>
<p>The security industry uses information as its sole commodity,
information about insecurity. Who has the information, and who doesn't
is what makes this economy work. Whats more, the economy has been
founded on the continued output of a finite group of hackers. For the
most part, founded on those hackers that came out of the underground
scene at their technical prime.</p>
<p>But these hackers are not going to continue their production
indefinitely. They will lose their technical edge, move on to other
industries, perhaps climb the ladder up to management, and then retire.
The question is, then what? Then it will be up to the new wave of young
security professionals, whose motivation is as much financial as it is
passion for the technology and the thrill of the hacking game.</p>
<p>To imagine that these new wave office workers, university trained and
disinterested, can match the creative output of a genuine hacker is
laughable. The industry will stagnate under these conditions. The rapid
technical advancement we have seen will end, no more breakthroughs: no
more new security products or services. Just the same old techniques
being rehashed again and again until the rock has been bled dry.</p>
<p>I am trying to show you the symbiotic nature of the security industry
and the hacking scene. Industry needs insecurity to survive, there is no
doubt about this. A secure and stable Internet is not profitable for
long. Hackers provided instability, change, chaos. So the industry
became a parasite on the hacking scene, devouring the talent pool
without giving anything back, not thinking of what will happen when
there are no more hackers to consume.</p>
<p>For this reason, the security industry, much like the hacker
underground, is doomed, perhaps even destined for failure. But for now,
all that matters is that we have a thriving industry and...</p>
<p>A hacker underground proclaimed to be dead.</p>
<h2 id="black-hat-two-faces">Black Hat, Two Faces</h2>
<p>It would be easy to lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of the
security industry. A lot of people have. Unfortunately, its not that
simple. Perhaps the underground could have survived without the lure of
a six figure job, but one thing should be made clear. The
self-proclaimed black hat movement does nothing to help.</p>
<p>Various black hat groups have claimed to be the voice of the
underground, but the black hat scene was only ever a pale imitation of
the actual underground. The underground wasn't at all interested in
public self-aggrandizement, but this is all the black hats ever did. All
that their various rants and escapades accomplished was to show how
desperate they actually were for fame and recognition.</p>
<p>But whats worse, while they often talk a big game, they very rarely have
the pedigree to back it up. This is mostly because these self-proclaimed
black hats are really just as self-serving as the white hats they
pretend to detest. With few exceptions, those black hats that aren't
already working in the security industry are those that don't have the
skills to cut it.</p>
<p>The entire anti-security theme was simply embarrassing. This was just
the black hat movement admitting that they couldn't step up and
represent in an increasingly technical world. Where once hacking skill
commanded respect, now the black hats were promoting misinformation in
order to make what few hacks they managed to pull off easier. They
couldn't step up to a challenge, they couldn't outsmart the white hats
they so detest.</p>
<p>This ineptitude and misguided fervor of the black hat scene had a
massive negative impact on the hacking underground. The true voice of
the underground was lost behind the noise and drama, until the voice
became a whisper.</p>
<p>And then eventually fell silent.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>The very nature of technology, a dynamic and intractable force, had a
lot to say in the demise of the hacking world. In many cases, if a black
hat had been active 5 or 10 years earlier they would have been
technically competent and may well have contributed significantly. This
is because with the utmost respect, and despite all the nostalgia,
hackers of the past had it easy.</p>
<p>In the early years, the problems hackers faced were largely related to
the availability of information. Isolated groups of people had their
tricks and techniques, and sharing this information was problematic.
This is in direct contrast with the situation today, where there is an
excess of information but a void of quality.</p>
<p>As a result of many differing factors, the world is becoming aware of
the threats posed by lax security. When there is money at risk, steps
will be taken to protect those assets. We see now an increasing move
towards technical security mechanisms being employed as part of a
defense in depth strategy, and as a result, to be a hacker today
requires immense technical ability in a broad range of disciplines. It
takes years of individual study to reach this level.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, fewer and fewer people are willing, or indeed capable
of following this path, of pursuing that ever-unattainable goal of
technical perfection. Instead, the current trend is to pursue the lowest
common denominator, to do the least amount of work to gain the most
fame, respect or money.</p>
<p>There has also been an increasingly narrow range in what is published.
In part this is because of the lack of accessibility of certain systems
(through obscurity or price), but this is also increasingly dictated by
fashion. In a desire to fit in with the community, to be accepted in to
conferences, to be seen doing the right things in the right places with
the right people, researchers are all too happy to slot in to this
pattern of predictable and narrow progress.</p>
<p>And even then, the standards of what makes acceptable research, or for
what makes a vulnerability interesting, drops with every year. The gap
between offensive research and defensive implementations continues to
grow, to the point where public vulnerability research has become a
parody of what it once was, a type of inside joke.</p>
<p>There is no creativity, no sense of arcana anymore.</p>
<h2 id="criminals">Criminals</h2>
<p>From Operation Sundevil to cyber terrorism. The criminalization of
computer hacking and, by association, computer hackers had a devastating
impact on the underground. Hacking was criminalized in two ways, both of
near equal importance: by legislation of computer crimes, and by the new
trend of genuine criminals using hacking as a method for fraud.</p>
<p>There should be a clear separation between these two things. The fact
that the underground collectively became criminals under the law for
what they had been doing for, in some cases, decades. And the fact that
in public perception, even among professionals that should know better,
there was very little distinction between a genuine hacker and those
criminals using hacking purely as a method for profit.</p>
<p>Indeed, little of what organized crime and terrorist/activist groups are
doing could justifiably be labeled hacking. It is simply convenient to
make this simplification, in media and in industry. The security
industry knows the difference, but they have no economic interest in
there being any clarity on this point. Any sort of hacking, anything
they can sensationalize enough to scare their profit margin up suits
them perfectly.</p>
<p>For the underground, these issues largely affected individuals, not the
broader structure of things. Each person had to make a personal decision
on whether it was worth 1) being seen as a criminal under the law and 2)
being seen as a criminal in public perception. Why should the hacker
face this when such an easy, safe, respectable alternative is available
in the security industry?</p>
<p>Even the term black hat has been twisted into something more closely
aligned to organized crime. For all their faults, black hats were not
(in theory) motivated by this type of money.</p>
<p>It comes down to an aging hacking population deciding, on an individual
basis, to settle down with their families, their material possessions,
their careers. No one can argue that there is anything wrong with this.
It is just a fact that these hackers left the scene behind.</p>
<p>Leaving a void too large to be filled.</p>
<h2 id="forgotten-youth">Forgotten Youth</h2>
<p>The forgotten aspect of this whole story is, without doubt, the
importance of new talent entering the world of hacking. Historically,
hacking has belonged to the young. With every passing year, the average
age of hackers collectively increases. Some would claim this is a sign
of a maturing discipline. For surely, what could youth possibly
contribute in this technological landscape? They call them kids, dismiss
them as irrelevant.</p>
<p>Despite all of the issues facing the underground, if hackers had managed
to get this one aspect right, if they had recognized the importance of
those who would come after them, if they had given them something to
aspire to be, if they had directly or indirectly taught them the
accumulated wisdom that so often separates a hacker from the crowd; then
perhaps there still would be a hacker underground.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the situations surrounding the disestablishment of the
underground were circumstantial, there was nobody to blame, and nothing
that could be done. But one point for which this was not true was the
underground's obligations to young hackers. An entire generation of
talented hackers have lost the opportunity to become a part of something
bigger than themselves by participating in a functioning hacking
community, simply because hackers were too self-absorbed to notice.</p>
<p>The decline of the underground scene happened relatively quickly, and
also relatively quietly. The hacker who left the underground behind for
his new life was unlikely to justify or explain his choices. In fact it
was more likely he would deny being changed at all. It's likely he'd
even continue to have contact with his fellow ex-hackers, in some
imitation of the underground scene. This only helped to obscure what was
actually happening.</p>
<p>Today's youth, for the most part, have no true understanding of hackers
or hacking. They have no knowledge of the history, no knowledge that a
history even exists. Their hacker is the media's hacker, the cyber
terrorist, the Russian mafia. This is unfortunate, but the real trouble
begins for those few that somehow become interested enough to look a bit
deeper.</p>
<p>The average person requires some form of role model, something to aspire
to, to imitate and to an extent, to idolize. At this time, the only
visible efforts were the white hat researchers, the black hat horde or
various other technically inept self-proclaimed 'experts'. There is so
little inspiring research, and even less inspiring hacking, that anyone
new to the world of hacking is almost invariably left with a skewed
impression of things.</p>
<p>Indeed, for a lot of the young people that managed to acquire the
necessary technical base, hacking was seen as simply an interesting
career path. There is no passion in these people, no motivation to
extend and create. A competent professional, valued employee.</p>
<p>But no longer a hacker.</p>
<h2 id="the-forward-link">The Forward Link</h2>
<p>The hacker underground has been systematically dismantled, a victim of
circumstance. There was no reason for this, no conspiracy, no winner. A
conquered people, but with no conqueror, no enemy to fight. No chance of
rebellion. Conquered by circumstance, if not fate.</p>
<p>At first this would seem to be a bleak message. What is the point of
even trying anymore? Why practice a dead art? But the truth is that the
art is not dead, just the circle that brought the artists together. The
hacker underground is broken, but the hackers are not.</p>
<p>Casualties have been high; but there still exists a scattered,
marginalized, and misrepresented people who are the hackers. Hackers,
not black hat nor white, not professionals, not amateurs (surely none of
this matters), are still out there in this world today, still with all
the potential to be something great.</p>
<p>The question is not then how to artificially group these people into a
new underground movement. The question is not how to mourn the passing
of the golden days, how to keep the memories alive. There are no
questions of this sort, no problems that can be solved or corrected by
individual action.</p>
<p>All that remains is to relax, to do what you enjoy doing; to hack purely
for the enjoyment of doing so. The rest will come naturally, a new
scene, with its own traditions, culture and history. A new underground,
organically formed over time, just like the first, out of the hacker's
natural inclination to share and explore.</p>
<p>It will take time, and there will be difficulties. Some will not be able
to let go of the past, and some will fail for not remembering it. But in
the end, after everything has been said and done, the equilibrium will
be restored.</p>
<p>A new world, at the frontier of cyberspace, belonging to the hackers by
right.</p>
